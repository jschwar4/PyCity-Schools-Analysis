# PyCity-Schools-Analysis
1.	Overview of the analysis: Explain the purpose of the new analysis.
•	This analysis displays the total fare each week for each city type between the beginning of January and the end of April. This can be used to compare the total revenue each week among urban, suburban, and rural fares. The chart allows for the comparison across time of the weekly revenue for each city type. Also, by virtue of being combined into the same chart, the reader can compare the change in total weekly fare of each city type over type.

2.	Results: Using images from the summary DataFrame and multiple-line chart, describe the differences in ride-sharing data among the different city types.

•	According to the above, urban areas generate a greater number of fares, but a smaller average fare on both a standalone and a per driver basis. There were approximately 13 times as many rides in urban areas as in rural areas, but the average ride per driver was more than ten dollars less. This difference in revenue becomes even more stark for the average fare per driver; the average rural driver’s fares are approximately 4 times smaller than the average urban driver. Suburban areas approximately split the difference between urban and rural areas on each metric.

•	The above chart demonstrates a slow growth over time in urban revenue, and a flat growth in revenue in suburban and rural areas. In all three cases the revenue generated during the strongest week is less than one thousand dollars less than the revenue generated during the weakest week. The above two observations suggest a slowly growing yet stable revenue stream.

•	In relative terms, urban fares generate the most revenue for the company by far. Urban fares generate approximately double the revenue of suburban fares and quadruple the revenue of rural fares. This disparity is stable over time.

3.	Summary: Based on the results, provide three business recommendations to the CEO for addressing any disparities among the city types.

•	These disparities in revenue among city types signal both opportunity and danger. Three recommendations for how to address these findings are as follows:

1.	The fact that the gaps in fares per ride appear to be inversely proportional to population density provide a road map to correct the disparities. Pyber should consider adding a combination of surcharges and/ or discounts that would flatten the gap. These could take a variety of forms that would apply across all fares, such as a starting fee or mileage discounts, or they could adjust rates and surcharges based on the city type of the fare.

2.	To adjust the difference in total fares between the different city types, Pyber should consider a marketing campaign in rural and suburban areas. This could increase the demand in areas that generate more revenue without impacting the existing urban market.

3.	Pyber should do further research to determine whether the disparity in total drivers is due to a lack of demand for rides and a corresponding lack of driving opportunities, or due to a dearth of drivers applicants. Should the answer be the former, the second suggestion here should suffice to increase rider demand and subsequently the total number of drivers. Should the latter be the case, a component designed to increase employment demand among potential drivers should be added to the marketing campaign suggested in the second recommendation.
